Complete the following problems. Both the syllabus rules and ADJ Ruleset 1v2 are in e ect.

M4: Operating-System Structures

<ol>

 <li>[Acuæa, Lisonbee] Di erent operating system structures o er both bene ts and drawbacks over one another, and it’s important to understand what kind of structure should be used for di erent use-cases.</li>

</ol>

Consider the following situation. You are designing an operating system for an interstellar probe that is meant to run for hundreds of years. The probe should also support monitoring many speci c instruments.

What structure (simple, layered, microkernel, or modular) should you choose for its kernel? Analyze the problem, design a choice, and justify the choice. [8A+2D+6J points] M5: Processes

<ol start="2">

 <li>[Acuæa] Consider parallelizing the insertion and selection sort algorithms. Which would be more amenable to parallelism? Analyze the problem, design a choice, and justify the choice. [6A+2D+8J points]</li>

</ol>

M6: Threads

<ol start="3">

 <li>[Acuæa] Consider the algorithmic task of compressing a video le for a cartoon. Initially, the video is a stream of separate images. The images are large, and in many places, di er only slightly from frame to frame. For instance, when an object is moving, the part of the image not involving the object does not change from one frame to the next.</li>

</ol>

Say we want to design a compression mechanism based on determining the di erence from the previous frame to the next frame, and saving only the di erence into a compressed result. Of the ve issues in multicore programming, which is the most problematic for multithreading this system? Analyze the problem, design a choice, and justify the choice. [8A+2D+8J points]
